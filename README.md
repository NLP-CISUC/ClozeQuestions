# ClozeQuestions

A total of 3,890 fill-in-the-blank questions created in the scope of the REAP.PT project [1], generated from sentences of the CETEMPúblico corpus [2], with candidate stems selected from the Portuguese Academic Word List [3] [4], refined to be in accordance with the distractors [5].

Previously used in the evaluation of lexical-semantic knowledge bases of Portuguese [6] [7]
